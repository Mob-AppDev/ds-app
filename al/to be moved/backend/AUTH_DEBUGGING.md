# Authentication Debugging Enhancements

## Overview
The authentication system has been enhanced to provide more specific error messages and detailed logging for debugging purposes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Specific Error Messages
Instead of the generic "Invalid username or password" message, the system now provides:

- **"Username does not exist"** - When the username is not found in the database
- **"Invalid password for username: [username]"** - When the username exists but password is incorrect
- **"Account is disabled for username: [username]"** - When the account is disabled
- **"Account is locked for username: [username]"** - When the account is locked
- **"Authentication failed: [error message]"** - For unexpected errors

### 2. Enhanced Logging
Added comprehensive logging with the following information:

- **Authentication attempt details** with timestamps
- **User information** including ID, status, and creation date
- **Specific exception handling** for different authentication failures
- **Success logging** with user ID and roles

### 3. Exception Handling
Added specific exception handling for:

- `BadCredentialsException` - Invalid password
- `DisabledException` - Account disabled
- `LockedException` - Account locked
- Generic `Exception` - Unexpected errors

## Log Format
Authentication attempts are now logged in a structured format:

```
=== AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPT ===
Username: [username]
Timestamp: [timestamp]
Details: [specific details about the attempt]
===============================
```

## Security Considerations
⚠️ **Important**: These detailed error messages are for debugging purposes only. In production, consider:

1. **Reverting to generic messages** for security (prevents username enumeration)
2. **Limiting detailed logging** to development environments
3. **Implementing rate limiting** to prevent brute force attacks
4. **Adding audit trails** for security monitoring

## Usage
The enhanced debugging is automatically active when the backend is running. Check the application logs to see detailed authentication information.

## Testing
To test the different error scenarios:

1. **Non-existent username**: Try logging in with a username that doesn't exist
2. **Wrong password**: Use a valid username with incorrect password
3. **Valid credentials**: Use correct username and password

## Reverting to Production Mode
To revert to production-ready error messages, modify the `AuthController.java`:

```java
// Replace specific error messages with generic ones
return ResponseEntity.badRequest()
    .body(new MessageResponse("Invalid username or password"));
```

And remove or disable the detailed logging methods.
